# **_Prince George's County Libraries_**

## **_Target browsers_**

PC users (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc). Website should work.
iPad users and tablet users can also use the website. Mobile users will be able to
use the website, but the map may be distorted. We will work on this in the future.

## **_Description_**

We used the Prince George's County Library API from the [PG County Website](https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Education/Libraries/7k64-tdwr)

## **_Visualization_**

We displayed a map using Leaflet and used markers to show where each library was located in PG County. We then used D3.js to create a chart displaying how many libraries were in each zip code based on the API.

## **Goal**

Our goal was to present users with a useful visualization showing where the libraries in the county are. In the future, we aim to add more features to increase the website's accesibility and usability like providing links to each library's website, phone numbers, etc.
